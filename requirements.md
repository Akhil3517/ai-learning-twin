# AI Skill Acceleration Platform Requirements

## Problem & Solution

**India's ₹10,300+ crore AI investment isn't creating job-ready talent fast enough.** Learners struggle with knowing what to learn, assessing true understanding, and navigating language barriers.

**Our Solution:** AI Learning Twin with False Confidence Detection that converts job roles into adaptive learning journeys, validates understanding through L1→L2→L3 challenges, and provides multilingual code mentoring to accelerate Bharat's workforce development.

## Key Terms

- **AI Learning Twin**: Digital skill mirror with False Confidence Detection and predictive learning analytics
- **False Confidence Score**: 0-100% metric that blocks progression when shallow understanding is detected
- **Adaptive Roadmap**: Timeline-aware learning path that skips redundancy and reinforces weak areas
- **L1→L2→L3 Learning**: Progressive challenges from basic to "failure at scale" scenarios
- **NIELIT Labs**: 30+ Indian government labs focusing on AI, cybersecurity, and emerging tech

## Core vs Supporting Capabilities

**Core Innovation:**
- False Confidence Engine (calibration-driven progression gating)
- AI Learning Twin (adaptive state + predictive analytics)
- Adaptive Roadmap (job-aligned skill paths with NIELIT mapping)

**Supporting Capabilities:**
- IDE Assistant (real-time code analysis + hints)
- Intelligence Feed (market trends + daily recommendations)
- Market Alignment (Amazon Q integration for job data)

## Requirements

### R1: Adaptive Learning Roadmaps

**User Story:** As a learner, I want AI-generated roadmaps that adapt to my performance, so I focus only on required skills and reduce learning time.

**Key Criteria:**
- Generate timeline-aware roadmaps from job role + skill level + time availability
- Prioritize NIELIT-aligned skills for Indian job market
- Skip mastered content, reinforce weak areas dynamically
- Optimize learning velocity based on user constraints

### R2: False Confidence Detection & L1→L2→L3 Learning

**User Story:** As a learner, I want progressive challenges that detect shallow understanding, so I develop real expertise instead of false confidence.

**Key Criteria:**
- Present L1→L2→L3 scenario-based questions with "failure at scale" challenges
- Calculate False Confidence Score (0-100%) and block progression when >60%
- Enforce conceptual clarity through targeted remediation
- Validate understanding with practical application scenarios

### R3: AI Learning Twin with Predictive Analytics

**User Story:** As a learner, I want an AI twin that predicts my learning patterns, so I receive personalized training that accelerates skill development.

**Key Criteria:**
- Build comprehensive skill profile (speed, gaps, preferences, outcomes)
- Predict learning roadblocks and optimal paths to competency
- Adapt recommendations in real-time as patterns evolve
- Focus on high-impact skills that accelerate job readiness

### R4: Multilingual Code Analysis & IDE Mentoring

**User Story:** As a developer, I want code explanations in my regional language and real-time IDE mentoring, so I can understand implementation gaps and code faster with confidence.

**Key Criteria:**
- Analyze code line-by-line, compare intent vs implementation
- Provide explanations in Hindi, Telugu, Tamil, Marathi with cultural context
- Live IDE interaction asking about intent, expected output, target scale
- Integrate AI Learning Twin for personalized coding hints and best practices

### R5: Intelligence Feed & Real-World System Design

**User Story:** As a learner, I want daily skill recommendations and system design understanding, so I stay market-relevant and can reason about production systems.

**Key Criteria:**
- Daily recommendations aligned with Indian job market and NIELIT labs
- Explicitly indicate "learn now" vs "skip" to reduce information overload
- Explain real-world system architecture, scalability, and failure scenarios
- Bridge gap between theoretical knowledge and practical implementation

### R6: Platform Security & AWS Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want secure profile management and AWS service integration, so the platform scales for Bharat's workforce while protecting my data.

**Key Criteria:**
- Secure authentication with encrypted profiles and Indian data compliance
- Amazon Bedrock integration for AI reasoning and code analysis
- Amazon Q integration for job market data and NIELIT alignment
- Kiro integration for voice queries and enhanced multilingual support

## Success Metrics

- **Learning Time**: 40-60% reduction to job-readiness vs traditional paths
- **False Confidence Reduction**: 90% improvement in actual vs perceived skill level  
- **Multilingual Impact**: 70% faster debugging with regional language support
- **Market Alignment**: 95% skill-to-job match with NIELIT requirements
- **AI Twin Accuracy**: 80%+ prediction accuracy for learning outcomes

## Non-Goals

- Replace formal education or provide employment guarantees
- Auto-generate production code without human oversight  
- Compete with course platforms (focuses on acceleration, not content creation)
- Support all programming languages initially (starts with Python, JavaScript, Java)

## MVP Implementation

**Phase 1**: Adaptive roadmaps + AI Learning Twin + False Confidence Detection
**Phase 2**: Multilingual support + Real-world code understanding  
**Phase 3**: IDE extension + Advanced AI Twin analytics
**Phase 4**: Full AWS integration + Platform scaling for Bharat's workforce
